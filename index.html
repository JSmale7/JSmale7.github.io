            When I was just 6 years old my dad built me my first computer. Immediately I was hooked on learning how technology worked. Soon (much to his chagrin) I took the computer apart to try and learn how it worked. As I've grown up I am less destructive, focusing on only taking apart the code.

            My fascination with technology merged with creativity to create a passion for video and film. Video production became a career for me with a specialization in editing. I am also adept in many roles from pre-production through post-production.
